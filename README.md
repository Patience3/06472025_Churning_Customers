# Churn Prediction App


## Overview


The Churn prediction is a web application designed for telecom companies to identify customer groups most likely to churn out. The app, built on Streamlit, utilizes a machine learning model trained on the history of customer purchases.


## Features


   Calculates the probability of a customer churning based on entered data.
   Provides a confidence level for the prediction.
   Allows users to clear predictions and readjust personal inputs.


## Getting Started


#### Software Requirements


  Python for code construction.
   TensorFlow and Streamlit for the app.
    No specific version control for this project.


#### Hardware Requirements


   No specific hardware requirements.
   The data is not large, and the model can be trained in a maximum of one hour.


#### Prerequisites
